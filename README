Arduino Keyboard

Developed by: Dan Ilin

A musical keyboard interface used to control the Arduino's tone() function.
The keys are mapped as follows:

Key - Function
  z - Octave Down
  x - Octave Up
  a - C (current octave)
  w - C#
  s - D
  e - D#
  d - E
  f - F
  t - F#
  g - G
  y - G#
  h - A
  u - A#
  j - B
  k - C (next octave)

To use the interface:

1) Connect your Arduino device to your computer via USB

2) Load the attached Arduino source code onto your Arduino device
(/Source/ArduinoKeyboard.ino)

3) Open the Arduino Keyboard application
(found in the Binaries folder, under the appropriate directory for your system)

Note: The interface will not work if the Arduino device isn't attached via a USB cable.
The interface communicates with the device using its serial port.
